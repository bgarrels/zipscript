===Iterator Directive===
*FM Implementation*
{{{[#list myList as entry] ... [/#list]}}}
  * ${entry_index} is special token to reference index number
  * ${entry_hasNext) is special token to reference if there are more entries
*ZS Implementation*
{{{[#foreach entry in myList] ... [/#foreach]}}}
  * ${i} is a special token to reference index number
  * ${hasNext} is special token to reference if there are more entries
  * scoped context (so ${i} will always relate to the appropriate loop index)

===While Directive===
*FM Implementation*
  * FM has no implementation
*ZS Implementation*
{{{[#while boolean expression ex: i<10] ... [/#while]}}}
  * ${i} is a special token to reference index number
  * scoped context (so ${i} will always relate to the appropriate loop index)

===Variables===
*FM Implementation*
  * You must start properties with lowercase eg: foo.bar will reference getBar() on foo
  * You can not reference objects in the session that contain a '.' in the key
  * Formatting variables is accomplished by using ?string.something

*ZS Implementation*
  * Properties can start with either uppercase or lowercase characters
  * ${foo.bar} will either reference foo.getBar(), foo.isBar(), foo.bar(), or context value retrieved with key 'foo.bar' in that order
  * Special token for formatting '|'  ex:
  # ${myDate|short} -> 12/25/2008
  # ${myDate|t:short} -> 10:37 AM
  # ${myDate|"MMM dd, yyyy"} -> Dec 21, 2008
  # ${myNumber|currency} -> $23,254.98
  # ${myNumber|"#,###.00} -> 23,254.98
