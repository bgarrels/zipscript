#Differences of ZipScript to Freemarker.

=Directives=
==Iterator Directive==
===FM Implementation ===
{{{[#list myList as entry] ... [/#list]}}}
  * ${entry_index} is special token to reference index number
  * ${entry_hasNext) is special token to reference if there are more entries
===ZS Implementation===
{{{[#foreach entry in myList] ... [/#foreach]}}}
  * ${i} is a special token to reference index number
  * ${hasNext} is special token to reference if there are more entries
  * scoped context (so ${i} will always relate to the appropriate loop index)

==While Directive==
===FM Implementation===
  * FM has no implementation
===ZS Implementation===
{{{[#while boolean expression ex: i<10] ... [/#while]}}}
  * ${i} is a special token to reference index number
  * scoped context (so ${i} will always relate to the appropriate loop index)
